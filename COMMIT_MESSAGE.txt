feat: Implement multi-agent AI-powered customer support system

Implement a complete multi-agent customer support chat system for TechFlow
Electronics using LangChain, LangGraph, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash.

## Core Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- Orchestrator Agent: Classifies user intents and routes conversations
- Retention Agent: Handles cancellation requests with empathetic responses
- Processor Agent: Executes confirmed cancellations and provides confirmations
- LangGraph workflow: Manages agent coordination and state transitions

### RAG System
- Document loading: Loads policy documents from data/ directory
- FAISS vector store: Semantic search using sentence-transformers embeddings
- Context retrieval: Retrieves relevant policy information for agent responses

### Customer Tools
- get_customer_data: Retrieves customer profiles from CSV
- calculate_retention_offer: Generates offers based on tier and cancellation reason
- update_customer_status: Logs customer actions to status log

### State Management
- ConversationState: TypedDict schema for shared state across agents
- State persistence: Maintains context throughout conversation flow

### CLI Interface
- Interactive mode: Real-time conversation with the system
- Test scenarios: Pre-configured test cases for all 5 required scenarios
- Observability: Detailed state information and agent activity logging

## Technical Implementation

- LLM: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via langchain-google-genai
- Embeddings: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Vector Store: FAISS with similarity search
- Framework: LangChain + LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Type Safety: Python TypedDict for state schema

## Test Results

All 5 test scenarios passed successfully:
1. ✅ Affordability-based cancellation
2. ✅ Device malfunction + cancellation
3. ✅ Value questioning
4. ✅ Technical support request (routed correctly)
5. ✅ Billing discrepancy inquiry (routed correctly)

100% intent classification accuracy
100% email extraction success rate
100% cancellation reason classification accuracy
